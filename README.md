- ROOM Database: To save and read the data from a local database, plus we are going to write some custom SQL queries as well.

- Compose Navigation: So we can navigate between our Screen Composables. 

- ViewModel: Which will contain all the logic needed to work with our app.

- Preference DataStore: To persist a simple key-value pairs.

- Dependency injection with Dagger-Hilt library.

_The problem: as you may notice the ViewModel is huge!!!_

How to turn the Architecture of this app Clean through the use of:

- MVVM together with Clear Architecture concepts
- UseCases, one UseCase per feature
- One ViewModel per Screen
- One Repository per screen
- View states

Also maintaining:

- Hilt for dependency injection (already in use)
- Room for database

Add-ons:

- Multi-module
- Tests
